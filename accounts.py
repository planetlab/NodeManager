"""Functionality common to all account classes.

Each subclass of Account must provide five methods: create() and
destroy(), which are static; configure(), start(), and stop(), which
are not.  configure(), which takes a record as its only argument, does
things like set up ssh keys.  In addition, an Account subclass must
provide static member variables SHELL, which contains the unique shell
that it uses; and TYPE, a string that is used by the account creation
code.  For no particular reason, TYPE is divided hierarchically by
periods; at the moment the only convention is that all sliver accounts
have type that begins with sliver.

There are any number of race conditions that may result from the fact
that account names are not unique over time.  Moreover, it's a bad
idea to perform lengthy operations while holding the database lock.
In order to deal with both of these problems, we use a worker thread
for each account name that ever exists.  On 32-bit systems with large
numbers of accounts, this may cause the NM process to run out of
*virtual* memory!  This problem may be remedied by decreasing the
maximum stack size.
